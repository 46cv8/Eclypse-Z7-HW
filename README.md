# Eclypse Z7 Base Vivado Project

This branch contains a Vivado project with the master XDC and a block diagram containing only a configured Zynq block. The vivado-library repository is included as a submodule.

This repository contains Vivado projects for each demo for the Eclypse Z7, version controlled on their own branches. Non-Vivado sources for Eclypse Z7 demos can be found through this repo's parent repository, [Eclypse Z7](https://github.com/Digilent/Eclypse-Z7).

For more information on how this project is version controlled, see the README of the [Digilent Vivado Scripts](https://github.com/Digilent/digilent-vivado-scripts) repository.
