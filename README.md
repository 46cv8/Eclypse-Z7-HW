# Eclypse Z7 Out-of-Box Vivado Project

This branch contains the Out-of-Box Vivado project for the Eclypse Z7. This project is placed in the Eclypse Z7's flash during manufacturing.

This repository contains Vivado projects for each demo for the Eclypse Z7, version controlled on their own branches. Non-Vivado sources for Eclypse Z7 demos can be found through this repo's parent repository, [Eclypse Z7](https://github.com/Digilent/Eclypse-Z7).

Since this repository uses submodules, when cloning the repo or switching between branches, make sure to call `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` to ensure that they are properly initialized.

For more information on how this project is version controlled, see the README of the [Digilent Vivado Scripts](https://github.com/Digilent/digilent-vivado-scripts) repository.
